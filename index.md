## What can we learn from 20 years of headlines?

Have you been ever thought about how the data we consume, is biased and most likely altering your everyday desitions.

To work with this subject,  we would have to think about different issues such as: the advent of a globalized world, the impact of major events in our understanding of our society, the acceptance of a more interconnected world and the new challenges that are unique to this era. For example, how attitudes towards politics and international organizations changed after the financial downfall of 2008? Or how has media treated the topic of climate change?
